Welcome to PHAAAS

What is PHAAAS?

PHAAAS stands for: The Plugable Http Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing
System. Basically it is a plugable HTTP proxy that provides customized
authentication, authorization, and auditing of HTTP resources.


Building

It is highly recommended to do development using Eclipse. The .classpath file is
included in the git repository for this reason.

You can build PHAAAS by using the included ant script:
	ant: compiles all the source
	ant check: compiles the source, then checks the configuration file
	ant jar: builds a standalone JAR file
