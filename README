Welcome to PHAAAS

What is PHAAAS?

PHAAAS stands for: The Plugable Http Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing
System. Basically it is a plugable HTTP proxy that provides customized
authentication, authorization, and auditing of HTTP resources.


Building

It is highly recommended to do development using Eclipse. The .classpath file is
included in the git repository for this reason.

You can build PHAAAS by using the included ant script:
	'mvn compile' - compiles all the source
	'mvn assembly:assembly' - builds a standalone JAR file

	For now you can run the stand alone like this:
	java -jar target/PHAAAS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
